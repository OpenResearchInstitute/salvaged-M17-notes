m17-demod.cpp


main reads cin and feeds one 16-bit sample at a time to demod()

    using FloatType = float;
    M17Demodulator<FloatType> demod(handle_frame);

bool handle_frame(mobilinkd::M17FrameDecoder::output_buffer_t const& frame, int viterbi_cost)

	M17Demodulator(callback_t callback)
	: decoder(callback)
	{}

This constructor initializes decoder, which is a M17FrameDecoder, to use the callback passed in, which is handle_frame.

later (line 548) there's this:

template <typename FloatType>
void M17Demodulator<FloatType>::operator()(const FloatType input)

this is a function call operator and makes a FunctionObject type.

Means a program can call demod(foo) where foo is a FloatType (and demod is a M17Demodulator type). This is used at line 489 in m17-demod.cpp

FloatType is float, defined in m17-demod.cpp in main, and used to instantiate M17Demodulator demod.

Correlator is in a SyncWord
callback_t is part of M17FrameDecoder

demod_filter is the BaseFirFilter that uses rrc_taps
dcd is a DataCarrierDetect<FloatType, SampleRate=SAMPLE_RATE, Accuracy=500>
	with freq1=2500, freq2=4000, ltrigger=1.0, htrigger=4.0
	and those parameters are passed through to variables:
	dft_ gets freq1 and freq1, and is an NDFT = NSlidingDFT
	initialized with SampleRate=SAMPLE_RATE=48000, N=SAMPLE_RATE/Accuracy = 960 (length of DFT), K=2 (number of frequencies).
	ltrigger_ and htrigger_ get ltrigger and htrigger.
clock_recovery is a ClockRecovery
correlator is a Correlator of appropriate FloatType
the three sync_word_t items are SyncWord<Correlator> (defined in Correlator.h)
dev is a FreqDevEstimator
framer is a M17Framer<368>
decoder is a M17FrameDecoder (created with callback handle_frame)
sync_word_type is a M17FrameDecoder::SyncWordType initialized to LSF
